## Introduction

Setting up reliable backups is one of the most important parts of running a home lab. In this tutorial, we'll walk through setting up an automated backup system using Borg for local backups with deduplication and Rclone for off-site cloud storage.

## Why Use Borg and Rclone?

BorgBackup (Borg) is a deduplicating backup program that supports compression and encryption. It's designed to be efficient and secure, making it perfect for backing up your important data.

Rclone is a command-line program to manage files on cloud storage. It supports a wide range of cloud providers, including Google Drive, Dropbox, and many others.
